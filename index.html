      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>If it's a challenge, I am up for it. Whenever I am not coding I like to be physically active. My main go to activity is soccer. I play every weekend with a recreational team. Secondly, I like to run. I try to go jog as often as possible especially in the summer. Lastly, I like to race cars. I participate in a simple form of racing called autocross. Nothing gets the adrenaline pumping like make a hard turn and hearing the tires screech.</p>
